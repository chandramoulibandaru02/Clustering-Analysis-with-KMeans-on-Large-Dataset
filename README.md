# Clustering-Analysis-with-KMeans-on-Large-Dataset
Using K means algorithm we are creating clusters it means we are grouping the distance of the customers
This project involves performing KMeans clustering on a large dataset containing over 290k records. The goal is to segment the data using unsupervised learning techniques to extract meaningful patterns and insights.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features for better clustering.

Clustering Model: Applied KMeans with an optimal number of clusters determined by the Elbow method.

Evaluation Metrics: Used Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Silhouette Score to evaluate clustering performance and assess cluster validity.

Visualization: Visualized cluster distribution and patterns to understand the grouping better.
